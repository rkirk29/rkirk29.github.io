# Fast.ai Notebook/ Lesson 2

Notebook 2 of the Fast.ai course (2020 version), easy to follow and run through the lesson in colab, impossible to use voila and binder to make it into a web app.

Now to use the code to make a classifier for something else.
I've converted the bear classifier into a Giraffe classifier
It was pretty difficult to know which subspecies to choose for the classifier as most of them do look pretty similar(at least it will be a challeneg for the classifier), but I landed on Masai, Reticulated and Nubian as I thought they might give me the best chance. 

I followd the original notebook swapping out bears for giraffes and the results were ok, I went through the cleaner and found it quite difficult to decide myself on the species which I think might be the problem, there did seem to be quite a few coming up under a different bing search. 
If I did it again I'd make sure to classify things I know will be labeled right in bing.

Here are the results after using the cleaner and re-running:

I uploaded my own picture of a Giraffe and it was confident that it was a Masai, to be honest I think it might be a Southern giraffe, but it does have some of the 'edginess' that the Masai does, so I'm fairly hapy with that.
